# EECS149

EECS 149/249A introduces students to the design and analysis of computational systems that interact with physical processes. Applications of such systems include medical devices and systems, consumer electronics, toys and games, assisted living, traffic control and safety, automotive systems, process control, energy management and conservation, environmental control, aircraft control systems, communications systems, instrumentation, critical infrastructure control (electric power, water resources, and communications systems for example), robotics and distributed robotics (telepresence, telemedicine), defense systems, manufacturing, and smart structures.

**Hints:** For some reason, I do not learn all the ackowledge of this course, so the `./hw` only contains some parts of the total resources, the important chapter I learn are as follows:

- [x] Chapter1 Introduction
- [x] Chapter2 Continuous Dynamics
- [x] Chapter3 Discrete Dynamics
- [x] Chapter7 sensors and actuators
- [x] Chapter8 embedded system
- [x] Chapter9 memory techonology
- [x] Chapter10 Input and Output
- [x] Chapter11 Mulititasking
- [x] Chapter12 Scheduling
- [x] Chapter13 Temporal logic
